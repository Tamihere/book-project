        Despising him, Māui’s four brothers conspired to leave
        him behind when they went out fishing. Overhearing their
        plans, Māui secretly made a fishhook from a magical
        ancestral jawbone. Then one night he crept into his brothers'
        canoe and hid under the floorboards.

        It wasn't until the brothers were far out of sight of land
        and had filled the bottom of their canoe with fish that Māui
        revealed himself. Then he took out his magic fishhook and
        threw it over the side of the canoe, chanting powerful
        incantations as he did so.

        The hook went deeper and deeper into the sea until Māui felt
        the hook< had touched something. He tugged gently and far below
        the hook caught fast. It was a huge fish!< Together with his
        brothers, Māui brought the fish to the surface.

        Māui cautioned his brothers to wait until he had appeased Tangaroa
        the god of the sea before they cut into the fish. They grew tired
        of waiting and began to carve out pieces for themselves.
        These are now the many valleys, mountains, lakes and rocky
        coastlines of the North Island.
